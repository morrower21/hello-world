Thoughts and designs

Hey interwebs!

I am a recent college graduate with multiple digital media and web content 
internships who successfully started his own digital media marketing company where I create and manage websites for small business.  I have a passion for web design and development and joined GitHub to increase my skills with certain languages and hopefully nab a web design/devlopment career.
